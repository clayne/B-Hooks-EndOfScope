- release the liquid horror swap

- update Makefile.PL even more by using [DynamicPrereqs] -include_sub, -condition options
    - see include_subs branch
    - possibly see stuff still in bourbon

- merge https://github.com/bobtfish/b-hooks-endofscope/pull/2
    i.e. https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=84872

    - fileformat needs to be fixed
    - tests use threads - skip when not threaded
    - tests fail - need to mark as todo!!! -- have someone test on an ActiveState install?
    - see https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=82922 for a potential solution?

- time to re-add [Test::Version] with a bumped :version?
    [Test::Version]
    ignore_unindexable = 1 ; this option doesn't exist yet
